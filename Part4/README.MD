This is the output we receive when we run ./part4.sh on terminal (after chmod a+x part4.sh)
As we can see, the above output is in the form of (total_comments, Median length of comments).
The mapper basically searches for a particular year and month and then produces the output in the form of months,commentlength and then the reducer4.py consolidates this data and finally produces the main answer in the form of no_of_answers,median_comment_length.

The plot4a.py and plot4b.py are independent python programs that generate two graphs, namely graph4a and graph4b respectively which show the freqency of comments/month/year and the median length of comments/month/year.

out.txt contains the data in txt format
