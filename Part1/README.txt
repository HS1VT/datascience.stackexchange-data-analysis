When we formed a table out of the entire dataset, we found that many files have common fields! On deep introspection we can observe that this is done majorly to connect or link the different files to each other. For example if we have to find out some correlation between any two files, we'll be needing some common fields to operate on like the UserId of 'PostHistory.xml' corresponds to RowId of 'Users.xml'. 

So when we had to find out the correlation coefficient between the total number of answers of the user and his/her reputation, we just found the common fields between the two files and there we go :)
