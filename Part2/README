The following commands were executed in order to complete part 2:

sed -i 's/"/ /g' Badges.xml
	This command removed all the double quotation marks (") in order to get all the names of badges independently, which was earlier not possible because it was attatched to Name=" ".
	
awk '{print $7}' Badges.xml > output.txt
	This line is used to store the names of all the Badges (Which are now in row 7 of Badges.xml)  in a new file called output.txt . We will be analyzing this data.
	
sort -u output.txt > Unique_Badges.txt
	This line is used to finish the redundancy in the names of Badges It removes all the duplicate names and we get a flie called Unique_Badges.txt which stores all the unique Badge names.
	
wc -w Unique_Badges.txt > No_Of_Unique_Badges.txt
	This line counts that how many uniqu Badge names are there and stores the number in the file No_Of_Unique_Badges.txt
	
cat output.txt | xargs -n1 | sort | uniq -c > Badge_Count.txt
	This line traverses output.txt and tells us that there are how many different users associated with each individual Badge and stores the data in Badge_Count.txt
	
echo "It took $SECONDS seconds for this script to execute."
	This command tells us that how many seconds it took to execute the script.



The Script of all these commands is made in a file named : part2.sh which is also placed in this folder
To run the script follow the following commands:

chmod u+x part2.sh
./part2.sh
