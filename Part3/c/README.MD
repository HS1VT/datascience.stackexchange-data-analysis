Most User activity: 16th hour (3916 posts)
Least User activity: 4th hour (1346 posts)
Ratio of peak to lowest user activity = (3916)/(1346) = 2.90

Answer:

The graph plotted between the starting hour and the number of posts made in that hour shows that the peak is achieved at 3916 posts between 1500 hours and 1600 hours i.e 3pm - 4pm, closely followed by the previous hour i.e 2pm - 3pm(3909 posts). This depicts that a majority of users using datascience.stackexcange.com are active during these hours. The lowest user activity according to the graph is recorded at 1346 posts between 300 hours and 400 hours i.e 3am - 4am.
Therefore, ratio of peak user activity per hour to lowest user activity per hour is 3916/1346 = 2.909(approx)



Deploying a cloud service in simple terms means that the company gets a platform to host all its data with a third-party. The cloud-based services make use of virtual technology to host the companyâ€™s applications offsite. There are numerous advantages of deploying cloud. Some include regular backing up of data, having to pay only for the amount of resources used which lead to lower hardware maintenance cost and less chances of data displacement.
The Stack Exchange network comprises around 173 question answer communities set up to facilitate developers in learning and sharing their knowledge. Some of these include Stack Overflow and DataScience Exchange. Currently, the Stack Exchange network has grown to serve more than 100 million developers and technologists every month. 
This clearly shows that Stack Exchange has thousands of users worldwide and will have to transfer data to all the global offices in order to provide services everywhere. Deploying cloud services in such a case, especially because there is a lot of data that needs to be stored, should turn out to be beneficial. Even in the case of a smaller branch of Stack Exchange like DataScience Exchange that we have worked on in this assignment, we have seen that the number of posts per month is massive. So, in the case of bigger compilations like Stack Exchange, the data size will be much larger and more difficult to handle, hence  making cloud-services beneficial.
In terms of cost, the amount spent on server hardware, power required to maintain this and space required to store data is cut down significantly with deployment of cloud. Stack Exchange will still have to pay the service provider for the resources they use but the cost of maintaining them is completely removed. 



Explanation of code:

The key value pairs received from reducer store the time of the day being considered in keys and number of posts made during that time in the corresponding values. A graph between these values is plotted using matplotlib library in python, the code  for which is given in plot.py and a png image of the output graph is also attached.
